# Linux Network Namespace

Linux network namespaces are a Linux kernel feature allowing us to isolate network environments through virtualization. Using network namespaces, you can create separate network interfaces and routing tables that are isolated from the rest of the system and operate independently.

* Linux namespaces are the basis of container technologies like Docker or Kubernates 

* Linux includes 6 types of namespaces: pid,net, uts, mnt, ipc, and user.
